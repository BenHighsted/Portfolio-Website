<!-- This file is my idea for the revamped index page of my website -->

<!-- Thinking for the front page, rather than a wall of text (like the current website) I want
Something simple, an image and a small amount of text (could even just be a few words) -->

    ways to reduce the wall of text like in the previous one. -->
