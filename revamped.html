                <p> My name is Ben Highsted. I graduated from The University of Otago on the 11th of 
                    December with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science. </p>
    
                <p> Having recently completed my degree, I’m looking forward to using the skills I have gained at University, 
                    in the IT Industry. I have a particular interest in Software Development, but enjoyed most aspects of IT covered 
                    during my studies at Otago University. </p>
    
                <p> During my time at University, I became proficient in the following programming languages: </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li> C </li>
                    <li> Java </li>
                    <li> Python </li>
                    <li> JavaScript </li>
                </ul> 
    
                <p> I also have experience in Web Development (HTML, CSS, PHP) and Databases (Such as SQL). </p>
    
                <p> While at school, I was a Prefect and Peer Support Leader. During my time at University, I enjoyed working individually 
                    and as a part of teams. I am able to work under pressure to meet deadlines while paying close attention to detail, 
                    and still keeping my sense of humour. I enjoyed the problem solving aspects of my course and learning new programming languages. 
                    I pride myself on being punctual and reliable. </p>
    
                <p> My interests include Personal Computers & Computer Gaming, Coding, Pop Culture Movies, 
                    Church and associated activities, Boating, Water-skiing and Fishing </p>
