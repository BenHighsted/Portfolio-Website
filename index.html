            <h1><u>Hi, I'm Ben.</u></h1>

            <p> My name is Ben Highsted. I graduated from The University of Otago on the 11th of 
                December with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science. </p>

            <p> Having recently completed my degree, Iâ€™m looking forward to using the skills I have gained at University, 
                in the IT Industry. I have a particular interest in Software Development, but enjoyed most aspects of IT covered 
                during my studies at Otago University. </p>

            <p> During my time at University, I became proficient in the following programming languages: </p>

            <ul>
                <li> C </li>
                <li> Java </li>
                <li> Python </li>
                <li> JavaScript </li>
            </ul> 

            <p> I also have experience in Web Development (HTML, CSS, PHP) and Databases (Such as SQL). </p>

            <p> While at school, I was a Prefect and Peer Support Leader. During my time at University, I enjoyed working individually 
                and as a part of teams. I am able to work under pressure to meet deadlines while paying close attention to detail, 
                and still keeping my sense of humour. I enjoyed the problem solving aspects of my course and learning new programming languages. 
                I pride myself on being punctual and reliable. </p>

            <p> My interests include Personal Computers & Computer Gaming, Coding, Pop Culture Movies, 
                Church and associated activities, Boating, Water-skiing and Fishing </p>
